					Apartment hunting is hard, especially for people who are new to the city. Mytopia is the Yelp for rental hunting, where city-dwellers post photos, reviews and ratings of their neighborhoods. House Hunters can use Mytopia for guidance in their housing search. Mytopia also pulls data from Zillow to keep demographic data up-to-date.

				<span class='problem'>The neighborhood page displays the demographic information of the neighborhood from Zillow. Locals can submit photos of the neighorhood, but the photos won't be shown until admins give approval to avoid spam photos. Locals can give ratings and write reviews of the neighborhoods. Users can also upvote, downvote or comment on any review.</span>
