						Apartment hunting is hard, especially for people who are new to the city. Mytopia is the Yelp for rental hunting, where city-dwellers post photos, reviews and ratings of their neighborhoods. House Hunters can use Mytopia for guidance in their housing search. Mytopia also pulls data from Zillow to keep demographic data up-to-date.
