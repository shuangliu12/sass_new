								<span class='description'>
									Networking has always been hard. Many people work in company-concentrated areas but lack opportunities to get to know others working in the same area. People usually build networks through LinkedIn, Meetup and friends. These mediums each have their own limitations. People want an easier way to meet other professionals and build connections.

								<h5 class="section_title">Ideation</h5>
								<span class='description'>
									I wanted to find an alterative way to help working professionals with busy schedules build connections with each other. This new method should have a low barrier to entry, be low cost, fun, low pressure, but also give users control over the quality of the networking. Users should be able to choose who they want to meet and have some background information about each other.
								</span>
								<span class='description'>
									During the interviews, I learned some interviewees hang out with co-workers during lunch time while others have lunch alone. People often buy lunch from places near work, but the choices are very limited and food is usually unhealthy and insipid. People who love to cook post their lunch plans on MEET AND LUNCH and make extra portions based on needs. People who don't want to cook can order a homemade lunch on MEET AND LUNCH. Lunch sharing is a natural way to meet other nearby professionals. Homemade food brings people together.
								</span>
								<span class='description'>
									Stakeholders: Chefs (people who offer lunch), Foodies (people who purchase lunch)

								<p class='use_case_description'>SOLUTION: Sofie used Meet and Lunch and searched for chefs in her working area. Sofie found Chef Lisa is a senior graphic designer. Sofie ordered a lunch from Lisa and had lunch with Lisa. Sofie had a great time chatting with Lisa and Lisa offered to refer Sofie to Lisa's company.</p>

								<p class='use_case_description'>PROBLEM: Leah bought too much beef and carrots. She wanted to make some beef stew, but she didn't think she could finish it. Leah is proud of her beef stew and would like to share with people.</p>
								<p class='use_case_description'>SOLUTION: Leah posted her beef stew on Meet and Lunch. Jen also likes beef and stew and placed an order. Leah is happy that she didn't have to waste food. She is also happy to meet new people.</p>
