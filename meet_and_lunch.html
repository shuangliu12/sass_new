					<span class='description'>
						Networking plays an every important role in career. Many people work in a company-concentrated areas but lack of a opportunity to get to know others who work in same industry. Traditionally, people build networks through alumni network, Meetup, LinkedIn or friends. It is hard to build personal connections through these mediums. People want an easier way to meet other professionals and build connections.

						I interviewed five target users in person. I asked interviewees about their work and life to gain insights about their lifestyles and their ways of social networking. I identified LinkedIn, Meetup and friends are the main ways to meet new people.

					<span class='description'>
						During the interview, I learned some interviewees hang out with co-workers during lunch time while others have lunch alone. People often buy lunch from places near work, but the choices are very limited and food is usually unhealthy and insipid. People(Chef) who love to cook can cook extra lunch portions and post them meals on Meet & Lunch. Foodies can order a homemade lunch from Meet&Lunch. Lunch sharing is a natural way to meet other nearby professionals. Homemade food brings people together.
