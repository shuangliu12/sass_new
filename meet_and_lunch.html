					For professionals new to a city, they may have a lack of quality networking and limited lunch options at work. This is where Meet &amp; Lunch comes in. People who love to cook can cook extra portions for lunch and post their available meals on Meet &amp; Lunch. People who are tired of restaurants near their offices can order a homemade lunch. Meet &amp; Lunch presents a natural way to meet other professionals. Homemade food brings people together.
