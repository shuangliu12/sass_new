			<span class="applicationTitle">MEET AND LUNCH | A Ruby on Rails web application for lunch sharing and networking</span>
			<span>
				For professionals new to a city, they may have limited lunch options at work and a lack of quality networking. This is where Meet & Lunch comes in. People can cook extra portions for lunch and post their available meals on Meet & Lunch. Other individuals who are tired of restaurants near their office can order a homemade lunch. Meet & Lunch presents a natural way to meet other professionals. Homemade food brings people together.

			<span class="applicationTitle">MONOLOG | A Ruby on Sinatra web application for mood tracking and expressive writing</span>
			<span>
				People in need of clinical services often report a lack of support outside of counseling sessions. Inspired by Dr. James Pennebaker’s Writing to Heal, I developed Monolog to offer support for people with mood disorders. Monolog keeps track of users’ emotional upheavals.

			<span class="applicationTitle">MYTOPIA | A Ruby on Rails web application for neighborhood reviews</span>
			<span>
				Apartment hunting is hard, especially for people who have newly moved to a big urban city. Mytopia is the Yelp for rental hunting, where city-dwellers post photos, reviews and ratings of their neighborhoods. Newcomers can use Mytopia for guidance in their housing search. Mytopia also pulls data from Zillow to keep demographic data up-to-date.

			<span class="applicationTitle">BULLS AND COWS PUZZLE | An Android game available on Google Play Store</span>
