							<span class='problem'>
								During my two year career as a mental health social worker, I found people in need of clinical services often reported a lack of support outside of counseling sessions. People can only schedule one or two counseling sessions per week to talk with their problems with a therapist. Inspired by Dr. James Pennebaker's <i>Writing to Heal</i> (2004), I created Monolog to offer support for people with mood disorders. Monolog gives people a private place to write about their emotionally challenging experiences and keep track of their emotional upheavals. Expressive writing facilitates healing.
