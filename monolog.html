					During my two year career as a mental health social worker, I found people in need of clinical services often reported a lack of support outside of counseling sessions. Inspired by Dr. James Pennebaker's <i>Writing to Heal</i> (2004), I created Monolog to offer support for people with mood disorders. Monolog gives people a private place to write about their emotionally challenging experiences and keep track of their emotional upheavals. Expressive writing facilitates healing.
